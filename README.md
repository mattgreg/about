Hi!

I am the CEO at [Ockam](https://www.ockam.io/). We build tools that allow developers to build applications that can trust data-in-motion.

Ockam has a simple developer experience and powerful primitives that orchestrate end-to-end encryption, key management, authorization policy enforcement, and mutual authentication. We are part of the zero-trust / shift left movement and our mission is to empower every developer to build appications that are secure by design.
