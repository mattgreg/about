Hi!

I am the CEO at [Ockam](https://www.ockam.io/), where we `Build Trust` for data-in-motion.

Ockam has a simple developer experience and powerful primitives that orchestrate end-to-end encryption, key management, authorization policy enforcement, and mutual authentication. We are part of the zero-trust / shift left movement and our mission is to empower every developer to build appications that are secure by design.

We are based in San Francisco California - but our team is remote first and spread all around the world. 
If you'd like to join our team full time, you can apply to join us [here](https://www.ockam.io/team)

Another great source to look at the activity in companies that build products ontop of an open source project is [Redpoint's Open Source Index](https://redpoint.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/5e802588-cc2c-489c-a2f3-283d6c3cd298?category=Security)

We love it when builders star the [Ockam OSS project](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam). We admire Snyk and see them as part of the Application Layer Trust movement. Here is a star history of traction between Ockam and Snyk:
