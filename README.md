Hi!

I am the CEO at [Ockam](https://www.ockam.io/). We are `Building Trust` for data-in-motion.

Ockam has a simple developer experience and powerful primitives that orchestrate end-to-end encryption, key management, authorization policy enforcement, and mutual authentication. We are part of the zero-trust / shift left movement and our mission is to empower every developer to build appications that are secure by design.

We are one of the fastest growing open source project based companies. We are based in San Francisco California - but our team is remote first and spread all around the world. 

If you'd like to join our team full time, you can apply to join us [here](https://www.ockam.io/team)

We love it when builders star the [Ockam OSS project](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam). We admire Snyk and see them as part of the Application Layer Trust movement. Here is a star history of traction between Ockam and Snyk:
